-- This code creates a simple interface for users to enter a city and get its current weather information displayed on the webpage.
### HTML:
It sets up the basic structure of the webpage with a title, input field for entering a city, a search button, and placeholders for displaying weather information like location, temperature, and description.

### CSS:

It styles the webpage, making it look nicer and more user-friendly.

### JavaScript:

It starts by defining constants for the API key and URL for the OpenWeatherMap API, as well as variables for accessing elements in the HTML document.
It adds an event listener to the search button so that when it's clicked, it triggers a function to fetch weather data.
The fetchWeather() function takes a location (city) as input, constructs a URL with the location and API key, and then fetches weather data from the API.
Once the data is fetched, it's converted to JSON format.
The retrieved data is then used to update the HTML elements with the location name, temperature, and weather description.
